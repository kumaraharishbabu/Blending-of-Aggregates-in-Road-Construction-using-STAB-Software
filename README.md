# Blending of Aggregates in Road Construction using STAB Software

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **blending of aggregates** for road construction to achieve 
the required gradation and performance standards. Aggregates play a vital role in 
ensuring the strength, durability, and stability of road layers. 

## Objective
- To determine the optimal blend of aggregates using **STAB software**.
- To meet the specified gradation requirements for road construction materials.
- To improve structural integrity and pavement performance.

## Methodology
- Aggregates of different sizes and types were analyzed.
- STAB software was used to proportion the aggregates for optimized gradation.
- Results were compared against standard specifications for road construction.

## Files
- `Aggregate_Blending_Report.pdf` – Documentation of methodology and results.
- `STAB_Input_Files` – Example input datasets for blending analysis.

## Tools Used
- STAB Software (for aggregate blending)
- MS Excel (data analysis and gradation plots)

## Applications
This project demonstrates the use of **aggregate blending optimization** in pavement 
design and construction, ensuring cost-effective and durable road structures.
